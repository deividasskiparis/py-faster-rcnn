Maybe you can try to merge caffe master branch into caffe-fast-rcnn.

cd caffe-fast-rcnn  
git remote add caffe https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git  
git fetch caffe  
git merge -X theirs caffe/master  
Remove self_.attr("phase") = static_cast<int>(this->phase_); from include/caffe/layers/python_layer.hpp after merging.
